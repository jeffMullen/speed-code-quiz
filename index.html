            <p>In this quiz you will be asked a hodgepodge of JavaScript questions. You have a countdown timer that will
                start at 75 seconds. If a question is answered wrong, the time will decrease by 5 seconds. If the timer
                reaches zero, the quiz is over. Afterwords, check out your score on the leaderboard!</p>

        <!-- create an article for each quiz question -->
        <!-- each section will be displayed as none or hidden until it is time to run that question -->
        <!-- maybe done with variables in an array, looped through -- on each loop the next index - section - will run -->
